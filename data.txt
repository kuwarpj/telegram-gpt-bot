What blockchain is NFTDraft built on? Wax
What is S1 and S2? S1 refers to the season 1 cards released by NFTDraft. S2 are the season 2 cards released. There will be a new set of cards released each season.What is the difference in S1 and S2 cards?Every year the cost to play a player is updated based on a number of factors including how they did last year, trades, draft picks and retirements. This cost to play a card from one year to the next can be significant and is a unique strategy to NFTDraft.
What makes S1 cards special? Each year as the new seasons cards are released, the previous seasons cards will incur a 3 scoring penalty. S1 cards will never incur this scoring penalty Example when season 3 cards are released, Cin QB 1 will cost 20 points for S2 and 20 points for S3 to play. He scores 10 points. If you play the S3 version you get the full 10 points but if you play the S2 version you only would get 9.7 points. The S1 version will get the full 10 points.
How are players assigned to cards? Depth charts are released before every game by each team. We use a third party service to validate the depth chart and set the IRL player to the position at the start of each game.

Can I benefit from holding season 1 /2? Yes, We will release a new deck each year. To encourage users to buy new packs, the cards from every previous season (with the exception of Season 1, 2021) will receive a 3% scoring penalty per year. So in Season 4 (2024), cards from Season 2 (2022) would have a 6% scoring penalty - unless they have been upgraded to Gold Foils! Some older cards cost less points, making them good to hold for future.
